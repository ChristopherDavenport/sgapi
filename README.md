# Sgapi

The Scala Google API that you always wanted. After wrapping the java interface,
I was still left very disatisfied with the api I was left with as it was stacked
with inheritance which made simple operations unnecessarily complex.

Here we offer a minimal algebras over subsets of the interface,
and allowing extension.
